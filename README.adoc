If you need a bunch of jar files you need to use in your tests, not as dependencies, but as artifacts you
need to use in the tests, you may have wondered how to do that without resorting to storing the jars in source
control or having an elaborate build set up where test archives would be built prior to the tests needing them.

This library brings simplicity to the picture. No need to invoke the compiler yourself, automatic cleanup taken care
of.

In JUnit5 all you need to do is:

```java

@ExtendWith(CompiledJarExtension.class)
class MyTestClass {

    @JarSources(root = "/sources-on-classpath/", sources = {"a/MyClass.java", "b/MyOtherClass.java"})
    private CompiledJar jarFile;

    @Test
    void test() {
        //directory containing the compiled classes
        jarFile.classes();

        //the actual jar file containing the compiled sources
        jarFile.jarFile();

        CompiledJar.Environment env = jarFile.analyze();

        //analyze the compiled classes as if in annotation processor
        TypeElement myClass = env.elements().getTypeElement("a.MyClass");
    }
}
```

In JUnit4 you can:

```java

public class MyTestClass {

    @Rule
    public Jar jar = new Jar();

    @Test
    public void test() {
        CompiledJar jarFile = jar.from()
            .classpathSources("/sources-on-classpath/", "a/MyClass.java", "b/MyOtherClass.java")
            .build();

        // now it works the same as above
    }
}

```
